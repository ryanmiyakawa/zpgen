Adding vscode compile support for Ryan's machine for the version of ZPGen in Xcode/

Configuration of this was kind of a pain, but was completed using this resource:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-clang-mac

For whatever reason, need to replace the tasks.json file with the one that they show in tutorial, not the one vscode generates in order to properly add system libraries to path.
